Hi, I’m Daniel Wu — a Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a strong passion for innovation in the biotech space. I’m especially interested in developing tech-driven solutions across a wide range of health applications by combining software, data, and engineering to solve real-world challenges in medtech.

Whether it’s building machine learning models for medical imaging, creating tools to simplify health data collection, or automating everyday workflows, I’m driven by opportunities to build meaningful, forward-thinking technologies. 

My experience ranges from developing apps that help individuals manage their health to contributing to research in drug discovery aimed at improving the drug synthesis pipeline. I’m excited to keep exploring the biotech space and to deepen my expertise in machine learning to build innovative solutions that make a real impact in healthcare.

I’m always open to collaborating on projects that aim to make a positive difference in the world.
