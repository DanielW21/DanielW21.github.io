Hi! I’m Daniel Wu, a Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a strong passion for innovation in the biotech space. I’m particularly interested in developing tech-driven solutions across healthcare by combining software, data, and engineering to solve real-world challenges in medtech.

My previous work spans building machine learning models for medical imaging, creating tools that streamline health data collection, and automating workflows to improve efficiency and accessibility in healthcare. I’m motivated by opportunities to design meaningful, forward-thinking technologies that translate engineering and data into real clinical impact.

I’ve gained experience developing applications that support individual health management, as well as contributing to work in drug discovery and clinical trial environments. More details can be found in my experience section. I’m excited to continue exploring the biotech space and to deepen my expertise in machine learning to build innovative solutions that improve patient outcomes.
I’m always open to collaborating on projects that aim to make a positive impact in healthcare.
