This was a group design project in first year in the course BME101L in which we designed a moon jellyfish using SolidWorks! The goal was to translate an  inspiration of an animal into a clear, modular CAD design with moving elements that can be 3D printed and produce step-by-step assembly instructions that could be followed by others.

## Final Design

## Project Overview
- Designed a complete CAD model of a moon jellyfish structure in SolidWorks  
- Used a planetary gear layout to create the moving tenticles
- Created assembly instructions to guide users through the build process  

## Tools & Skills
- SolidWorks (part modeling, assemblies, mates)
- Design for assembly
- Technical documentation
