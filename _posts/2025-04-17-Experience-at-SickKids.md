From January to April, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a Research Student in the Department of Molecular Medicine. I‚Äôm especially grateful to my amazing mentors, [Michal Koziarski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-koziarski/?originalSubdomain=ca) and [Stephen Lu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenzlu/), as well as the brilliant group of researchers, professors, and graduate students at SickKids and the University of Toronto.

Over the term, I had the opportunity to explore how machine learning can accelerate and enhance the drug discovery pipeline by supporting the synthesis process. This inspiring experience deepened my understanding of how computational tools can integrate seamlessly with experimental workflows to address real-world biomedical challenges. Through hands-on work in data processing, model development, and interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and chemists, I gained valuable insight into how large-scale research operates‚Äîbridging the gap from whiteboard concepts to wet lab execution in both clinical and academic environments.

This experience has been especially meaningful as I work toward my goal of contributing to the biotech space. I‚Äôm excited by the opportunity to apply what I‚Äôve learned ‚Äî from algorithmic thinking to practical applications of machine learning ‚Äî to industries that transform this kind of research into impactful, real-world solutions. Whether it's optimizing workflows in drug development or supporting existing tools in biotechnology, I want to help bridge the gap between innovation and implementation.

Thank you again to Michal and Stephen for their mentorship, patience, and generosity in guiding my learning throughout the project. (And an extra shout-out to the Research Program Managers for giving out lots of snacks during those long days üçïüçéü•™‚òïÔ∏è)
