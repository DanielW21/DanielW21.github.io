# SolidWorks F1 Car Project

For my final project in BME 101L, I decided to showcase my CAD skills by building something I'm passionate about, a detailed replica of a Formula 1 race car! This project allowed me to demonstrate my technical abilities while working on something that genuinely excited me.

## Project Overview

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
  <img src="/assets/Posts/F1-Car/F1-Car.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 15px; color: #666;">3D CAD model of Formula 1 race car designed in SolidWorks</p>
</div>

## Project Outcome

This F1 car project was a fun way to demonstrate my SolidWorks proficiency. It was a fun and engaging way to conclude BME 101L, with a project I throughly enjoyed making!

The detailed model captures the essence of modern Formula 1 design while demonstrating my ability to create complex, multi-component assemblies in a professional CAD environment.
