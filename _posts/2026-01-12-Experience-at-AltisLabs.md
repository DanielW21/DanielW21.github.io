## Machine Learning Engineer at Altis Labs

During Fall 2025, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Altis Labs, contributing to the development of machine learning systems for clinical risk modeling using CT and MRI imaging. In this role, I gained hands-on experience applying ML in a healthcare setting, with a focus on upgrading core pipeline components, running experiments to improve production models, and building tools that support reproducibility, traceability, and documentation.

I worked primarily with chest CT data and imaging-derived features informed by clinical literature, gaining exposure to radiology workflows within the pipeline and the challenges of working with medical imaging modalities. My work spanned survival analysis modeling, adapting pretrained radiology foundation models for clinical tasks, and understanding how data quality and feature selection influence model behavior.

Beyond modeling, I helped build tooling and infrastructure to support reproducible experimentation and reliable deployment, including experiment tracking pipelines and quality-control tools for imaging datasets. I had a great experience learning from my mentors at Altis Labs and deepened my appreciation for the engineering required to translate end-to-end machine learning systems into real clinical impact.
