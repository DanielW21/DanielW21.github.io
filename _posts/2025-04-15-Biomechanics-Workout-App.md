# Ongoing Project - **Physiq**  
### Workout Form Correction & Teaching Biomechanics Through an Educational App

---

### 📌 Project Status:  
**Currently in the planning phase.**  
- Gathering advice from fitness professionals and academic mentors  
- Applied to [Velocity](https://www.velocityincubator.com) to help grow the idea

---

### 🧠 Project Vision:  
**Physiq** is an educational fitness app designed to help users understand the biomechanics of exercise and muscle engagement—think *Duolingo*, but for learning about your body and improving workout technique.

Users will progress through structured lessons that teach:
- How different exercises target muscle groups
- Safe and effective exercise form
- The principles of biomechanics

---

### 💡 Planned Additional Features:
- **Form Feedback via Computer Vision:**  
  The app will use a camera to watch the user perform exercises and provide feedback to correct form in real-time.

- **Personalized Advice:**  
  Takes into account:
  - Individual fitness goals
  - Injuries or restrictions
  - User’s current level and progression goals

- **Food and Nutrition Context**
  - Combine nutrition with goals to create more reasonable learning progression
